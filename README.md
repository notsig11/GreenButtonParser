# Parser for GreenButton Energy Usage Data
DTE Energy gives customers the ability to download hourly meter read data for the last 13 months in their customer portal or to generate a link that an application can use to download that data.  

The link returns an XML file specified by the [GreenButtonAlliance](https://github.com/GreenButtonAlliance) For more information see the [Open Energy Information Wiki](https://openei.org/wiki/Green_Button_Developer) for more information.

## Future plans
1. cURL support for fetching data directly
1. PostgreSQL support for storing meter readings
1. Grafana Dashboard?
